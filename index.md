## About Me
Driven and enthusiastic computer science student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, dedicated to
using technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a passion for learning and a strong work
ethic, I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can collaborate, contribute, and continue to grow.

## Projects
Some of my projects are:

### [Benefits in a Click]([link-to-project-1](https://itaedel.github.io/Benefits-In-A-Click/))
Benefits in a Click is a user-friendly platform where users can search and compare credit card benefits based on the credit clubs they are members of and help them save money.
I used Node.js for the back-end, HTML and CSS for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the databases, and python for the web crawlers
to get the data.
