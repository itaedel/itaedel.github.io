## About Me
Driven and enthusiastic computer science student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, dedicated to
using technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a passion for learning and a strong work
ethic, I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can collaborate, contribute, and continue to grow.

## Projects
Some of my projects are:

### [Benefits in a Click](https://itaedel.github.io/Benefits-In-A-Click/)
Benefits in a Click is a user-friendly platform where users can search and compare credit card benefits based on the credit clubs they are members of and help them save money.  
I used Node.js for the back-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the database, and Python for the web crawlers to collect the data.

### [ASCII-Art Creator](https://github.com/itaedel/ASCII-ART/)
I developed a Java program named ASCII-Art Creator, designed to convert any image into ASCII art effortlessly.  
The program features an intuitive interface, enabling users to interact with and customize the output image according to their preferences.
