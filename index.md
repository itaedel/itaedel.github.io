## About Me
Driven and enthusiastic computer science student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, dedicated to
using technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a passion for learning and a strong work
ethic, I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can collaborate, contribute, and continue to grow.

## Projects
Some of my projects are:

### [Benefits in a Click](https://itaedel.github.io/Benefits-In-A-Click/)
Benefits in a Click is a user-friendly platform where users can search and compare credit card benefits based on the credit clubs they are members of and help them save money.  
I used Node.js for the back-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the database, and Python for the web crawlers to collect the data.

### [ASCII-Art Creator](https://github.com/itaedel/ASCII-ART/)
I created a a Java program that turns every image into ASCII art easily.  
Built an interface to allow the user to interact and customize the output image.
