## About Me
Driven and enthusiastic computer science student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, dedicated to
using technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a passion for learning and a strong work
ethic, I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can collaborate, contribute, and continue to grow.

## Projects
Some of my projects are:

### [Benefits in a Click](https://benefits-in-a-click.netlify.app/)
Benefits in a Click is a user-friendly platform where users can search and compare credit card benefits based on the credit clubs they are members of and help them save money.  
I used Node.js for the back-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the database, and Python for the web crawlers to collect the data.

### [Machine Learning Hackathon](https://github.com/itaedel/ML-Hackathon)
Participated in a hackathon project focused on public transportation data analysis, implementing data
cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to accurately predict trip durations.  
I employed a variety of machine learning models, including Neural Networks, AdaBoost, and Random
Forest Regression, to optimize prediction accuracy

### [Analyzing and Predicting Trends in Academic Research](https://github.com/itaedel/Academic_Research_Trends)
In this group project my goal was to analyze and predict trends in academic research over time, focusing on identifying trending topics and mapping collaboration patterns among researchers across different fields. This project leverages data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to identify the most popular research topics, track their evolution, and visualize these trends dynamically. Additionally, we aim to investigate co-authorship patterns to uncover interdisciplinary collaboration networks, revealing how different research fields are interconnected through joint efforts.

### [Movie Recommendation Library](https://github.com/itaedel/MovieRecommendation)
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive C++ library aimed at managing recommendation systems and user data for major streaming companies. The purpose of this library is to enable these companies to offer highly accurate and personalized movie recommendations to their customers. The library includes a robust set of features designed to handle user and movie management, recommendation generation, data persistence, and more.

### [ASCII-Art Creator](https://github.com/itaedel/ASCII-ART/)
I developed a Java program named ASCII-Art Creator, designed to convert any image into ASCII art effortlessly.  
The program features an intuitive interface, enabling users to interact with and customize the output image according to their preferences.
